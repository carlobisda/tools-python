My repository of tools I created using Python.

#TOOLS

    qRandom.exe - CLI randomizer taking input from a text file
    keybinds.exe - simple Win10 screenlet that acts as a reminder of the 
    important keybinds I have in the system
    lvlGen.exe - CLI ASCII random dungeon creator (ala Rogue style); generates 
    random dungeons that I can use as reference for FPS level design.

#WIP

    - app that will download tweets for the current day
    - app/dashboard that keeps track of my life, cyberpunk edition



#NOTES

    all apps were compiled by PyInstaller
