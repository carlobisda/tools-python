A simple keybind reminder for Windows 11.
I started using keybinds in a more advanced way with Win11
as I'm planning to work alot more with Arch and I would like
both environments to be somewhat similar if I can manage.

One of the features ArchBang had is a simple keybind reminder
permanently on the screen as a sidebar.

So I decided to write one in Python for my usage as well.

1.0.1
- added an opacity feature

#WIP
- add more customization feature
- add a function to edit keybinds natively

#METHOD
Just compile and execute, can be compiled as an EXE.
To edit text, open keybinds.md with the text editor of choice and edit away.
Note: keybinds.md must exist for the program to work, filename is hard coded
into the program.
